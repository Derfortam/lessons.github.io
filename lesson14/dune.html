                                        <p> The House of Atrid is a noble family of great plot importance in the Dune
                                            universe created by writer Frank Herbert. House Atrid is one of the Great
                                            Houses of the intergalactic feudal empire. Representatives of the House of
                                            Atrid play a significant role in each novel of the series.

                                            The author traces this dynasty back to the famous ancient Greek family of
                                            Atrides, which suffered a tragic fate for several generations (Atreus,
                                            Thyestes, Agamemnon, Orestes, etc.).

                                            Since the time of the Butlerian Jihad, the Atrides' homeworld has been the
                                            planet Kaladan. The first representatives of the family to permanently
                                            reside on the planet were Estes and Cagin, the sons of Veronica Tergiet and
                                            Vorian Atrid, the son of the Titan Agamemnon.

                                            Under Emperor Shaddam IV, the Atrides gained possession of the desert planet
                                            Arrakis, and the family moved to Arrakin, its capital.</p>

                                        <p>The Sardaukars or Imperial Sardaukars are soldiers of the elite guard of the
                                            Padishah Emperors of Corrino from the Dune universe. The prototype of the
                                            Padishah Empire in the Dune books is usually the Ottoman Empire.
                                            Accordingly, the Sardaukars are compared to the Turkish infantry, the
                                            Janissaries.</p>
                                        <p>The Sardaukar were fanatically loyal to the Padishah-Emperors of the House of
                                            Corrino, the Great House that ruled the entire known universe before and
                                            during the events described in Dune. Before Paul Atrid organised the Fremen
                                            on Arrakis, the Sardaukar were the most powerful military organisation in
                                            the Empire, and the most feared. The Sardaukars were the force that kept the
                                            House of Corrino on the throne, so in the course of their service,
                                            Sardaukars could achieve high social status.

                                            From an early age, the Sardaukars trained on the planet Salus Secundus, the
                                            ancestral planet of the House of Corrino, which became the "prison planet"
                                            of the Corrino Emperors after the atomic bombing. The Sardaukars were
                                            organised into legions, each consisting of 10 brigades, with a total of
                                            30,000 soldiers in a legion. Before the events on Arrakis, one legion could
                                            restore order on any planet that dared to provoke the Emperor's anger.</p>

                                            sentient machines. While the Atrides are described as noble men of honour,
                                            the Harkonnens are portrayed as ambitious, not above meanness and intrigue.

                                        <p>The Fremen are a tribe of people in the Dune universe, a series of books by
                                            American writer Frank Herbert. The Fremen live on the planet Arrakis, also
                                            known as Dune.

                                            also known as Dune, a desert planet that is the only source of spice from
                                            which they make melange.

                                            The Freemen arrived on Dune thousands of years before the events of the
                                            novel as Zen Sunni travellers, a religious sect (its name appears to be a
                                            hybrid of Zen Buddhism and Sunnism) in exile. Over the centuries of living
                                            on Arrakis, the Freemen have adapted to its harsh climate. They called
                                            themselves the Free People of the Dune.</p>
                                        <p>Freemen live in sitcoms. Everyone has their own nayb, whose word is law until
                                            someone rejects their leadership in a fight. Polygamy is practiced. The
                                            Freeman system of justice is based on court fights. The naib of the tribe is
                                            the person who killed the previous naib in a duel. Any Freeman can challenge
                                            another to a duel under any pretext related to a violation of the rules of
                                            etiquette, law, etc.; the winner assumes responsibility for the wife,
                                            children and part of the property of the loser and, accordingly, satisfies
                                            his demands that led to the duel. Duels are held without distichcomb, so
                                            that by specially processing the body of the loser into water, the losses
                                            during the fight are reimbursed to the winner.</p>
